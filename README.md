# The-Code-Share

### A Little about THE CODE SHARE
Code Share is a platform that provides Groups an ability to code together without being together in one place. The app has an option to work on coding challenges sourced from an NPM PACKAGE _PJS PROBLEMS_ or to work/share individual code collabratively. The app provides a built in _CODE EDITOR_ sourced from another NPM PACKAGE _CODEMIRROR_. The app will also provide a feature where USERS can find coding events based on the USER input language. USERS will also be able to create their own events. The app will provide a feature for _AUTHS_ thus enabling the USERS to post specific events connected to their profile.
